 Reports say that Microsoft will abandon the Windows 8 Start screen interface for traditional computers in the next version of Windows, code-named Threshold. That's a pretty drastic step. Does it mean that Microsoft recognizes that Windows 8 was the biggest operating system bust in its history?

Mary Jo Foley reports that the next version of Windows, due out in 2015, will adapt itself to whatever hardware it's installed on -- and that means that for desktops and laptops, the Windows Desktop will be front and center, along with a Start menu. Users never need to see the Start screen if they don't want. Tablet and phone users, on the other hand, won't even have the Desktop to go to.
